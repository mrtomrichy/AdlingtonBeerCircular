				<p>
				Welcome to the Adlington Beer Circular (ABC)! Adlington is a Village situated in Lancashire, between Chorley and Bolton.
				</p>
				<p>
				I have created this website to combine two of the things I enjoy, Walking and Real Ale. I have designed a few circular walks which take in the local ale establishments. The walks all start at the train station and end in a pub very close to the station, meaning you can leave the car at home and enjoy a pint or two!
				</p>

				<p>You could attempt the Original 10 and take in all the Pubs on the full circular, however, there are also walks for people who do not want to walk as far, or don&#39;t want to drink as much! There are plenty of options, you could even make your own walk!<br/>
				Please, come and try the walks, have a pint and mention you are doing the ABC, I am sure you will get a warm welcome!</p>
				<p>
				Disclaimer - I am not affiliated with any of the pubs, I am not responsible for the quality of the beer (although they are usually great!) or any changes in the opening/closing times. I will try and keep the website as up to date as possible and if you do notice anything which is no longer accurate, or have any comments about the walks, please e-mail me on the contact address, I will see what I can do!</p>
				<p class="signoff" style="">Hopefully, <i>Ale B C&#39;ing you</i>!</p>
